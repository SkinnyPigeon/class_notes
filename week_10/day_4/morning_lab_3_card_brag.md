# Lab

Today's lab is to think about how you would implement the game of 3 Card Brag (the rules of which can be found here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_card_brag ) in Java. Betting is NOT required. 

At this stage we are only asking you to PLAN how you would do this i.e. think about which classes you think you would need, any interfaces you would use etc.

Think about the logic you would need to find the winning player and how to compare hands.

Remember to think about what tests you would need.

IF YOU ARE REALLY AMBITIOUS then you can think about adding betting to the game.

In the afternoon we will have a go at writing the code!
