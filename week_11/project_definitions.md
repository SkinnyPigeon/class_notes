#Java/Android Project Definitions - Solo Project

##To-Do List

Goal: Practice what we learned in the Java / Android weeks and research how to persist data. 

###MVP
You are required to write an app which will allow the user to maintain a task list. The user should be able to enter tasks and display them in a list. The list should only show the bare details of each task. Selecting a task from the list should bring up another screen which shows full details of the task.
Users should also be mark tasks as completed.

###Project Extensions

* Allow the user to prioritise and/or categorise tasks
* Use the calendar to set due dates on tasks. 

## Snake

Goal: Implement a Snake-esque game in Android.

You've been asked to implement a game in Android which is similar to Snake.

You must be able to:
* Keep score - gain points when you eat items (e.g. apples)
* Have a game over condition when the snake hits the side of the screen or itself

We recommend using on screen buttons to control the snake.

###Project Extensions
* Have different kinds of items, each worth different values of points
* Have detrimental items that cost you points or end the game
* Difficulty settings that affect snake speed
* Make snake get faster and/or grow in length as it eats items

***DO NOT USE ANY FRAMEWORKS***



##Food Tracker

Goal: Practice OO and UI design with what we learned in Java / Android weeks 

You are required to write an application that allows a user to track the food they eat. Users should be able to enter what they eat and when (date/time) and for what meal. 

The app should show the user a record of what they have eaten over a given period e.g. In March I drank lots of Irn-Bru.

##Shop

Goal: Practice OO modelling in Java (unit tests, no UI)

You are required to build an app that allows a Shop to sell goods to a Customer. Stock and items are not important. 

The Shop must be able to:

* Make a Sale
  - The customer funds go down, shop sales go up
* Give a refund
  - The customer funds go up, shop refunds go up
* Report on income
  - Total sales minus total refunds

The Customer must:

* Have a collection of possible Payment Methods:
  - CreditCard (default), DebitCard
* Be able to select a Payment Method to pay at any Shop
* Be able to select a Payment Method to recieve a refund onto a given Payment Method

(You may find HashMaps useful for this project) 

###Project Extensions

* Add stock tracking
